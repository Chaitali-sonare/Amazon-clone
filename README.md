Project Title: Amazon Homepage Clone
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS

Description:
I created the first page of the Amazon website using HTML and CSS to replicate its layout and design. The project includes a responsive header with navigation, a search bar, product categories, promotional banners, and footer sections. This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, particularly in structuring web pages and styling elements for visual accuracy.
